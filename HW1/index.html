                        <ul>This line graph is clearly very hard to follow due to several
                        factors and is overall bad. In terms of conveying information,
                        it is missing a y-axis label. The x-axis also has some unusual
                        categories that span more than just one year, but the lack of
                        consistency is even more disturbing. The y-axis also does not start
                        at 0, and there is no note to warn the reader of this. The time
                        eriod spanned by the entire x-axis is also seemingly arbitrary
                        since we do not know why they chose to start at 1967, and the jumps
                        between successive x-axis labels is not a constant number of years
                        (4 year jump from 1967 to 1971 but also one five year jump from
                        2014 to 2019). Now, in terms of the color scheme, we see the most
                        egregiously bad choices. It seems to be relatively unbiased, not
                        evoking any particular emotion, but the color scheme makes the
                        lines, words, and other info very hard to read. There is no particular
                        reason, it appears, to be using this color scheme, so it’s very low
                        data-ink ratio (due to the completely blue background) is poor choice.
                        The lines with the white-outline data points are also hard to follow
                        since, in particular, the black axes and lines and very hard to
                        distinguish from the blue background, and the green is also not bright
                        enough either. Given a less messy color scheme, this low-information
                        visual might be easier to read since it is fairly simple and could
                        fit the needs of a basic, factually-inclined audience with no need
                        for jargon understanding (given that axes were edited as well).
                        Overall, the author was likely trying to convey percentage of women
                        and men who have voted at each year indicated on the x-axis and compare
                        how the gap has changed over time.

                        <ul>This visualization, though easier to read than the previous,
                            still has some issues and is overall bad. For instance, these
                            are a set of a clustered bar graph and a histogram, but the
                            clustered bar is oriented horizontally and the other vertically,
                            with no apparent justification. The title of the whole diagram
                            doesn’t give us any information for the information content,
                            and the axis labels for the horizontal bar clustered bar graph
                            aren’t clearly related to any question that the subtitle might
                            hint at, and they are not presented in any logical order. Thus,
                            for both charts here, we’re not sure of the information we’re
                            meant to understand. Also, a legend is used instead of more
                            detailed axes, making it hard to look back and forth for the bar
                            labels. There are also no axes label for the height/length of
                            the bars, so we don’t know if they are scaled correctly. The
                            terms used in the graph are also rather advanced, and since
                            for this visual we know the intended audience was an online
                            magazine/news page, the readership is likely not familiar enough
                            with the jargon from the article to comprehend this visual fully.
                            However, overall, the color scheme makes it more readable, and
                            the highlighting of alternate rows in light grow in the clustered
                            horizontal bar graph also adds to clarity. Overall, the author
                            was likely trying to demonstrate, in the left visual, the various
                            business metric percentages achieved by three life insurance
                            companies, and, in the right visual, the “embedded value” of the
                            three, overall demonstrating their profitability and success in
                            comparison to each other.

                        <ul>This is a distribution plot from the Pew Research Center was meant
                            by the author to show the ideological placement of various news
                            sources in relation to each other and on a scale from -10 (more
                            consistently liberal) to 10 (more consistently conservative,
                            overall revealing trends in reporting bias based on a survey of
                            web respondents’ opinions. This visualization is overall good
                            because it is very readable, has a high data-ink ratio, is
                            unbiased in its information presentation and color choices, and
                            is relatively medium information density (making it accessible
                            and readable to many audiences but overall interesting to
                            academics given the subject matter and presentation). Colors are
                            used to highlight things, with consistent themes, such as black
                            for the different companies and red to indicate the direction of
                            the scale and the average respondent’s position on the scale.
                            The data points are to scale, and the extending pointers are
                            positioned for maximum readability. This visual could have been
                            better if it grouped certain types of media together (such as
                            radio shows, national tv news, etc.) to show more of the variation
                            within the media included. However, overall, it is a very accessible
                            and clear visual for a clear subject purpose.

                        <ul>This is an example slopegraph for comparing gradients, and is
                            actually from Edward Tufte, The Visual Display of Quantitative
                            Information, 158-159. The authors goal was to show trends in
                            government tax collection in 1970 compared to 1979. The y-axis
                            scale is consistent and evenly-spaced on both sides, starting
                            from a reference point of Japan on both sides as well. On this
                            scale, the rank of 15 countries by government tax collections is
                            displaced, and there is a line connecting the two data points for
                            each country illustrates the slope of the change, giving us visual
                            cues for which countries have seen more drastic changes (slopes
                            with higher absolute values). This data has a very high data-ink
                            ratio, non-biased and even coloring and scaling, and is readable
                            and unoffensive to audiences of any level of understanding of the
                            subject matter, making it a very good visualization (no surprise).
                            The title is very relevant, and the axes are labeled but all
                            gridlines are removed, giving us a very minimal, non-nonsense,
                            standard-Tufte design. Perhaps it could have been enhanced with
                            slope numbers also labeled, but there would have also been a
                            tradeoff of slightly reduced readability, though the information
                            could have been useful for strict quantitative comparison purposes.
